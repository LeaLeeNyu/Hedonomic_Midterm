SETUP:

Locate the light prefabs found in the New Axis Studio/Sci Fi Lighting Pack/Prefabs/Lights folder. Simply drag the desired light prefab into the scene. With the light selected you will be able to adjust a few parameters in the inspector. Lights may be duplicated and modified.


GENERAL NOTES:

Depending on your scene and lightmapping settings you may need to use a mix of baked and mixed lighting, bearing in mind lighting limitations.

You may need to adjust the "Indirect Multiplier" value of the lights for the desired GI result.

Some lights use a small "Baked Shadow Radius" value to allow the light to pass through very close geometry. If the scale of the light mesh is significantly altered this value may need to be changed.
